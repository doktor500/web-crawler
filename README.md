## Problem

Build a web crawler that generates a site map

## Dependencies

- Java 8
- sbt
- npm

## Execute the project with sbt

    sbt "run https://www.thoughtworks.com"

## Execute the tests with sbt

    sbt test

## Assemble the project and execute it

    sbt assemble
    java -jar ./target/scala-2.12/crawler.jar https://www.thoughtworks.com

# Visualize the site map graph

- Execute the project
- Install local-server with `npm install -g local-web-server`
- Run local server with `ws`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`Â 

### Approached followed

To deal with the concurrency nature of the problem, the crawler has been implemented using a functional programming style and an approach based on an actor system implemented with Akka.

### Assumptions

- Url normalization has not been taken into account, that means urls such as `http://www.thoughtworks.com`, `https://www.thoughtworks.com`, `https://www.thoughtworks.com:80` will be treated as different urls
- It is OK to filter all the URLs that contain a '#' or ':'
- Validation is not done for input parameters
