### Assumptions

- Url normalization has not been taken into account, that means urls such as `http://www.thoughtworks.com`, `https://www.thoughtworks.com`, `https://www.thoughtworks.com:80` will be treated as different urls
- It is OK to filter all the URLs that contain a '#' or ':'
- Validation is not done for input parameters
